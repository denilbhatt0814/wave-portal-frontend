## Wave Portal

Wave portal is an implementation of a project from [BuildSpace](https://app.buildspace.so/projects/CO02cf0f1c-f996-4f50-9669-cf945ca3fb0b). The project had been with use of solidity for the smart-contract and âœ¨ react as the frontend.\
The project taught me how to connect a smart contract ðŸ”— to a frontend and make funciton call ðŸ“ž from the smart contract. It also taught how to work with events.\
